# DIY Guide: Proof-of-Theory Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Device

## **Overview**
This guide outlines how to build a low-cost, self-contained Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) device capable of basic decision-making based on pre-trained AI models. The goal is to create a modular and open-source unit that runs entirely offline, with all necessary components stored on a removable SD card. This device is meant for personal experimentation only and is not intended for medical or commercial use.
