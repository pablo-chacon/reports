### **Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up the Microcontroller for the Wind-Turbine System**

The microcontroller, such as a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, plays a key role in monitoring, managing, and optimizing the performance of your wind-turbine system. It can be programmed to measure power output, control load balancing, and integrate with your home energy system.

### **Requirements**
1. **Hardware**:
   - Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
   - MicroSD card (32GB recommended)
   - Power supply for Raspberry Pi
   - Sensors (e.g., voltage, current, and wind speed sensors)
   - Relay module for load control
   - Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection (optional, for remote access)

2. **Software**:
   - Raspberry Pi OS (Lite or Full, depending on needs)
   - Python or other preferred programming language
   - Libraries for sensor integration (e.g., `Adafruit_Blinka`, `RPi.GPIO`)
   - Database for logging (SQLite or PostgreSQL)

### **Step-by-Step Setup**

#### 1. **Prepare the Raspberry Pi**
   - Flash the Raspberry Pi OS onto the microSD card using tools like Balena Etcher.
   - Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.
   - Follow the initial setup wizard to configure Wi-Fi, username, and password.

#### 2. **Install Required Software**
   - Open the terminal and update the system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - Install Python, necessary libraries, and database tools:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip sqlite3
     pip3 install RPi.GPIO Adafruit-Blinka
     ```

#### 3. **Connect Sensors**
   - Wire up sensors for voltage, current, and wind speed to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
   - Use the relay module to control power routing (e.g., switching between battery charging and grid export).

#### 4. **Write the Monitoring Script**
   - Example Python code to read sensor data:
     ```python
     import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
     import time

     # Pin setup
     WIND_SENSOR_PIN = 17
     GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
     GPIO.setup(WIND_SENSOR_PIN, GPIO.IN)

     try:
         while True:
             wind_speed = GPIO.input(WIND_SENSOR_PIN)  # Read wind speed sensor
             print(f"Wind Speed: {wind_speed}")
             time.sleep(1)
     except KeyboardInterrupt:
         GPIO.cleanup()
     ```
   - Expand the script to log data and control relays as needed.

#### 5. **Set Up Data Logging**
   - Create a SQLite database for storing turbine performance data:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS turbine_data (
         timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         wind_speed REAL,
         voltage REAL,
         current REAL
     );
     ```
   - Modify the Python script to insert sensor data into the database.

#### 6. **Remote Access and Alerts**
   - Install tools like `ssh` or `VNC` for remote management.
   - Use libraries like `smtplib` to send email alerts for system malfunctions.

#### 7. **Test the System**
   - Run the monitoring script and ensure all sensors provide accurate readings.
   - Simulate conditions (e.g., wind speed) to verify load control.

### **Purpose of the Microcontroller**
- Monitor real-time performance of the wind turbines.
- Log data for analysis and optimization.
- Automate power management (e.g., redirecting excess power).
- Alert users about faults or maintenance needs.
