This document outlines the implementation of a decentralized power market integrated with the cluster-in-cluster wind-turbine system. The system enables households or small communities to become energy producers while facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. This decentralized model reduces dependency on centralized power networks, provides economic incentives, and encourages green energy adoption.
Purpose

To empower individuals and communities with complete control over their energy production, distribution, and consumption. This system aims to decentralize the energy market, eliminate reliance on monopolistic power providers, and create a fair, efficient, and sustainable model of energy independence.
Key Features

    Cluster-Based Power Generation:
        Each cluster consists of 5â€“10 households with their own wind-turbine systems.
        Clusters connect to form larger networks, enabling power sharing and trading.

    Decentralized Market:
        Blockchain technology ensures transparent and secure energy trading.
        Smart contracts automate transactions between energy producers and consumers.

    Optimized Energy Flow:
        Microcontrollers monitor power generation and consumption in real-time.
        Excess power is traded within the network or stored in batteries.

    Independence and Sustainability:
        Reduces reliance on centralized grids.
        Encourages local energy production and consumption.

System Architecture
1. Cluster Formation

    Each household installs a micro-wind-turbine system managed by a microcontroller.
    Microcontrollers are connected to a cluster controller, which aggregates data for the entire cluster.

2. Decentralized Power Market

    Blockchain Network:
        A blockchain ledger records energy production, consumption, and transactions.
        Smart contracts handle energy pricing and trading rules.
    P2P Trading:
        Households trade excess energy with neighbors within the cluster.
        Dynamic pricing adjusts based on supply and demand.

3. Integration with Larger Grids

    Clusters connect to form a regional grid.
    Excess power from regional grids is sold to the national grid, if allowed, or stored for later use.
