This document presents some estimations of the combined High-Performance Fan and Liam F1 Turbine spiral. Making a A highly effective and silent turbine. 


Noise Level (dB)

The Liam F1 turbine is renowned for being virtually silent, often producing noise levels below 45 dB at its operating speed. Here’s what to expect:

    Fan Integration Effect: The high-performance fan adds minimal turbulence due to its smooth, optimized housing.
    Estimated noise level: 40-50 dB (similar to a quiet conversation or a home refrigerator).

If the system is fine-tuned, housing dampened, and designed with precision:

    Noise could even drop to 30-40 dB, nearly inaudible in typical outdoor environments.

Power Generation Estimate

The energy output depends on wind speed, blade efficiency, and total area swept. Here’s the calculation:
Assumptions:

    Wind Speed: Average of 5-7 m/s (moderate wind region).
    Rotor Diameter: Assume 1.0 meter diameter for a compact spiral turbine.
        Swept Area = π × (D/2)² = 0.785 m².
    Efficiency: Wind turbines typically capture 30-40% of available wind energy due to Betz's Law. A high-efficiency design like the Liam F1 could hit ~45% efficiency.
    Power Density: Wind energy per square meter at 5-7 m/s ranges from 60-150 W/m².
    Operational Time: Assume the system operates 50% of the year effectively (~4380 hours).

Power Formula:
P=0.5×Air Density×Swept Area×Wind Speed3×Efficiency
P=0.5×Air Density×Swept Area×Wind Speed3×Efficiency

Example Calculation:

    Air Density = 1.225 kg/m³
    Wind Speed = 6 m/s (average)
    Swept Area = 0.785 m²
    Efficiency = 45% (0.45)

P=0.5×1.225×0.785×(6)3×0.45
P=0.5×1.225×0.785×(6)3×0.45
P≈57W per turbine
P≈57W per turbine
Annual Power Output:

Convert to annual energy (assuming 50% uptime, 4380 hours):
Energy (kWh/year)=Power (kW)×Operating Hours
Energy (kWh/year)=Power (kW)×Operating Hours
Energy=0.057 kW×4380 hours
Energy=0.057kW×4380hours
Energy≈250kWh/year per turbine.
Energy≈250kWh/yearper turbine.
3. System Scaling

For a household consuming 4000-5000 kWh/year:

    You would need 16-20 turbines in optimal wind conditions.

For a cluster of 10 households:

    Approximately 160-200 turbines would suffice.

Conclusion

    Noise Level: 40-50 dB (very quiet, even for residential areas).
    Annual Power Output: ~250 kWh/year per unit.
    Using the combined design improves stability and efficiency, allowing smaller systems to be effective for micro-generation.
