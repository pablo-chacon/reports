### **Key Components**
1. **Micro Biomass Reactors (Combustion Chambers):**
   - Each reactor functions as an independent combustion chamber.
   - Biomass pellets serve as fuel, combusting to generate energy.
   - Equipped with ignition systems (e.g., spark or glow plugs) to initiate combustion.

2. **Crankshaft and Pistons:**
   - Reactors are mechanically connected to a central crankshaft.
   - Each reactor’s combustion drives pistons, converting linear motion into rotational energy.

3. **Fuel Delivery System:**
   - A central hopper feeds biomass pellets into each reactor using a gravity-fed or auger-based mechanism.
   - Fuel delivery is synchronized with the combustion cycle for optimal efficiency.

4. **Cooling System:**
   - Integrated air or water cooling systems prevent overheating of reactors.
   - Ensures consistent performance and longevity.

5. **Exhaust System:**
   - Compact exhaust outlets channel combustion byproducts away from the system.
   - Includes filters to reduce emissions.

6. **Control Unit:**
   - A microcontroller synchronizes the ignition and fuel feeding mechanisms.
   - Monitors performance metrics like temperature, fuel levels, and rotational speed.
