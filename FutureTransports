Theoretical Future Transport System Report

Autonomous Vehicles sometimes is proclaimed as a hype and facing big challanges to evidence their potential. This is because of the lack of enough data. 
Basically Autonomous Vehicles can't get enough good data because they don't have enough good data. I tried to came up with a solution on that problem.
It also take aim at solve the energy of transportation by self-suffient transport.
