Key Insights
1. Economic and Strategic Interests in War

    Resource Control: Historically, wars have often been driven by the desire to control valuable resources. For example, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 is widely perceived to have been motivated by oil reserves.
    Military-Industrial Complex: The defense industry's vested interest in ongoing conflicts perpetuates a cycle where military engagements justify increased spending, benefiting defense contractors.

2. Gaddafi’s Vision for an African Financial System

    Unified African Currency: Gaddafi proposed a single African currency backed by gold to reduce dependency on Western financial systems, aiming for economic independence in Africa.
    Resistance: This vision was seen as a threat to Western economic dominance, leading to significant opposition.

3. Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

    Decentralization: Blockchain offers a decentralized financial system independent of central banks and governments, providing transparency and reducing fraud.
    Regulatory Pushback: Governments resist cryptocurrencies to maintain control over financial systems and protect traditional investments, citing concerns over economic stability and illegal activities.

4. Russia and China’s Financial Strategies

    Yuanization: Russia has increased the use of the Chinese yuan for international trade, reducing reliance on the US dollar.
    Alternative Financial Systems: Both countries are developing systems like the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to bypass Western financial systems and sanctions.

Conclusion

The notion that "war is just business" is supported by the consistent pattern of economic and strategic interests driving conflicts. Historical and contemporary examples illustrate how economic motivations underpin geopolitical maneuvers. The resistance to blockchain technology and financial cooperation between nations like Russia and China further highlights the ongoing struggle for economic independence and control.
